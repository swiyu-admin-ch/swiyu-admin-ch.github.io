With the upcoming releases in the different repositories we will fix some issues raised by the community and deliver also features from the initial gaps of the swiyu Public Beta Trust Infrastructure.  We also announce first steps related to the [Expand-Migrate-Contract](https://github.com/swiyu-admin-ch/community/blob/main/tech-concepts/expand-migrate-contract-pattern.md) pattern to avoid breaking changes. For a more detailled view please refer to the CHANGELOG.md in each repository.

## Generic Issuer & Generic Verifier

We put together the management- and signer-service on the issuer side (resulting in a new repository "swiyu-issuer") as well as the management- and validator-service on the verifier side (resulting in a new repository "swiyu-verifier"). The cookbooks will be adjusted accordingly. The existing issues on the deprecated components will be moved to the new repositories.
